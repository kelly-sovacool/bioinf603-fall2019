### Background
- **Microbial community profiling**: Characterize which microbes are present and how abundant they are.

- Application: detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)
  - Colonoscopy is invasive, but the best way to detect CRC.
  - Profiled microbiota from fecal samples of cancer patients and healthy individuals.
  - Classified individuals as healthy vs cancer based on microbial DNA, compared to colonoscopy results as ground truth.
  - Microbial community profiling improved classifications over other less-invasive methods.

- Asexual reproduction
- Fast evolutionary change
- Horizontal gene transfer

### Background: Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)

- Proxy for microbial species (or any desired taxonomic level).
- Created by clustering sequences based on sequence similarity.
- Avoids difficulties of classifying bacteria into species, especially when unknown organisms are present.

### Background: Key Questions Raised

- Is there a core set of microbial species or genes that all humans share?

- How do changes in microbial abundances at particular taxonomic levels relate to health & disease?

## Techniques: Overall Workflow

### Techniques: Sequencing

#### Metagenomics _vs._ 16S rRNA

|   | Metagenomics | 16s rRNA |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Technique** | Whole-genome shotgun sequencing | Only sequence part of the 16S rRNA gene |
| **Purpose** | Measures functional potential of the whole microbiome | Sufficient to estimate which microbes are present and their abundances |
| **Organisms** | Bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi | Bacteria & archaea only | 
| **Requirements** | Need long reads to cover genes | Short reads are sufficient |
| **Cost** | üí≤üí≤üí≤ | üí≤ |

### Techniques: Sequencing 16S rRNA gene regions

```

**Fig. 4 A**: V2 and V4 yield similar results to the full-length gene. V6 is not recommended due to the many unclassified sequences.

### Techniques: Clustering OTUs

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/multi-omics_16S-rRNA.jpg")
```
]

- Cluster similar 16S sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs).
- Compare abundances of OTUs within and across samples.

### Techniques: Clustering OTUs

1. Calculate all pairwise sequence identity scores to create a distance matrix.
2. Apply cutoff of 97% sequence identity to create an adjacency matrix.
.center[
```
seqA AGGGTACG
seqB ACG-TACG
```
$$ \%\ sequence\ identity =  100 * \frac{number\ of\ matches}{sequence\  length} $$
]
.pull-left[
1) Distance matrix:

| | Seq1 | Seq2 | Seq3 |
|-|------|------|------|
| Seq1 | - | 98 | 87 |
| Seq2 | 98 | - | 76 |
| Seq3 | 87 | 76 | - |
]
.pull-right[
2) Adjacency matrix:

| | Seq1 | Seq2 | Seq3 |
|-|------|------|------|
| Seq1 | - | 1 | 0 |
| Seq2 | 1 | - | 0 |
| Seq3 | 0 | 0 | - |
]

### Techniques: OTU clustering algorithms

.center[
```{r, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/F5.E-F.jpg")
```
]

**Fig. 5 E & F**

- Nearest-neighbor: greedily add a sequence if it is similar to *any* sequence in the OTU
- Furthest-neighbor: only add a sequence if it is similar to *all* other sequences in the OTU
- Average neighbor: compromise between the two.

### Techniques: Comparing communities
- Alpha diversity: how many OTUs are in a sample
- Beta diversity: how are OTUs shared among samples
- Community membership: presence/absence of OTUs
- Community structure: relative abundance of OTUs

### Techniques: Comparing communities

Phylum-level: relative abundance
.center[
```{r, out.width='80%'}

**Fig. 3**: 22 human gut samples show quite different abundances.

### Techniques: Comparing communities
OTU-level: presence/absence of OTUs

.center[
```{r, out.width='60%'}

**Fig. 4B**: PCoA on full-length 16S samples. All methods give equivalent results, clustering the samples by individual.

- Unifrac (phylogenetic): distance between a pair of communities as the proportion of evolution that is unique to one community or the other.

- Euclidean & Kulcynski are taxon-based distance metrics.

  - Clustering
  - Comparing Communities
- **Discussion**
- My Conclusions

## Discussion: Key Questions Addressed

- Is there a core set of microbial species or genes that all humans share?
  - Microbiomes between individuals vary greatly by which species are present and their abundances.
  - No species are shared at high abundance.
  
- How do changes in microbial abundances at particular taxonomic levels relate to health & disease?
  - Focus on gene sets, rather than taxon levels, to compare functional potential of microbiomes.

## Conclusion

- Summarizes the techniques, best practices, and questions to consider in microbial community analysis at the time (2009).
- Although many of the tools and technologies have changed, the concepts presented here are still relevant today.

---

### Limitations

- Lacked substantial discussion of the strenghs & weakenesses of different clustering algorithms.
  - Many other algorithms besides nearest & furthest neighbor.
  - How does the quality of OTU assignments produced by different algorithms compare?
- Did not discuss limitations of phylogenetic-based comparison of communities with Unifrac.
  - Unifrac only tests whether communities have the _same_ structure; does not indicate a level of similarity.
  - Taxon-based methods do quantify a level of similarity.
- Mentions some of the tools used (e.g. Unifrac, DOTUR), but there are many gaps for a full analysis pipeline.

### Advancements since 2009

- Illumina MiSeq / HiSeq instead of 454 Pyrosequencing.
- mothur & QIIME: comprehensive tools for microbial community profiling.
- optiClust: OTU clustering algorithm in mothur.
